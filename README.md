One can login and start tracking his time on a work.
Usr should write description first and then click on play button. It will start counting the time.
However user can start tracking time without puting the description. But in that case he should click on the timer and in dialogue he should update the start time and then hit stop to enter the record.
In Report page user can search any entry by keyword and during sarch user can narrow down the result by selecting the date range.
